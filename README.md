# ESG Data Integration and Analytics Platform
## Overview
This project is designed to provide an integrated view of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) scores for companies listed in the S&P 500. The platform enables users to explore ESG performance metrics across various sectors and companies, offering visual insights and detailed analysis based on the processed data.

## Features
Company-Specific ESG Analysis: Users can search for individual companies by their ticker symbol to view detailed ESG scores, including Environmental, Social, and Governance scores, along with other relevant metrics like Controversy Level and Sustainability Score.
Sector-Wise Analysis: The platform calculates and visualizes the average ESG risk across different sectors, helping users identify industry-specific trends and risks.
Visual Insights: Provides graphical representations of data, such as sector risk charts and company ESG score comparisons, to enhance user understanding of ESG metrics.
Dynamic Data Processing: The project uses a processed dataset (processed_sp500_companies.csv) that integrates and cleanses the raw data to ensure accurate and up-to-date analysis.
